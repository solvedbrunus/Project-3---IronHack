# Project 3 IronHack| - NLP 

## Project Goals

Development of a product review website powered by an NLP model(s)
The model(s) aggregates customer feedback from different sources
Find and reuse existing LLMs, don’t use classical techniques
Main tasks: 
Classify customer reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories to help the company improve its products and services. 
Cluster product categories into just 4-6 of them
Use Generative AI to summarize reviews into an article which recommends the top products for each category


## Project Phases 

Create a model for classification of customers' reviews (the textual content of the reviews)into positive, neutral, or negative. 

The dataset categories are too sparse. Create a model to group all reviews into 4-6 “meta” categories. 

Create a model which, for each product category, generates a short article, like a blogpost reviewer would write, to help customers choose the best one for them.

Here’s a suggestion of what the model may output
The Top 3 products and key differences between them. When should a consumer choose one or another?
Top complaints for each of those products
What is the worst product in the category and why you should never buy it
More ideas: Look at the Consumer Reviews website, The Verge, The Wirecutter
